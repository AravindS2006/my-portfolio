## 🚀 About Me

I’m Aravind, an AI Engineer focused on deploying research-quality models into production. I combine deep learning, systems engineering, and product thinking to ship robust, explainable, and efficient ML systems.

- 🔬 Research-driven: prototype rapidly, validate thoroughly
- 🏗 Production-first: reproducibility, monitoring, and scaling
- 🤝 Collaborative: cross-functional teams, clear technical writing

## 🔧 Core Skills

- Languages: Python, SQL, Bash
- ML & DL: Transformers, CNNs, Transfer Learning, Self-Supervised Learning
- Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, scikit-learn
- MLOps: Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Airflow, CI/CD, Terraform
- Data: ETL pipelines, feature engineering, large-scale data processing
- Cloud: AWS (SageMaker, Lambda), GCP, Azure

## ✨ Selected Projects

- LLM-powered Personal Assistant — LLM + retrieval-augmented generation to answer domain-specific queries with real-time grounding and safety layers. (Link: /projects/llm-assistant)
- Computer Vision Defect Detection — End-to-end pipeline: dataset curation, augmentation, model (EfficientNet/YOLO), and deployment with monitoring and alerting. (Link: /projects/cv-defects)
- Scalable ML Platform — Infrastructure as code for reproducible training & serving (Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Terraform). (Link: /projects/ml-platform)
- Research & Publications — Summaries and reproducible notebooks for papers on representation learning and model efficiency. (Link: /projects/research)

Each project includes architecture diagrams, reproducible notebooks, and deployment instructions.

## 🧭 How I Work

1. Frame the problem & evaluation metrics
2. Prototype quickly with clear baselines
3. Harden: testing, monitoring, and fairness checks
4. Automate: CI/CD, infra-as-code, and scheduled retraining

## 📈 Metrics & Impact

I prefer to highlight measurable impact: improved accuracy, inference latency, reduced cost, increase in user engagement, or reduced manual effort. Example metrics are included in each project page.
